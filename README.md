# README #

The game project is the second one I build, I build it because, I couldn't find something that satisfied what I needed to manage my Games, mainly remembering who had borrowed what. I was tired of getting a game back thinking, is this mine? I diden´t recall lending it out.
I quickly figured it was easy to take the code of my original Movie project and just alter the database fields and then it could be used for Games, it was easy to dublicate the code making sure they were identical from a code point of view, no need to create it from the ground up when I already had code working right?
There are some out there of course, if I recall correctly they cost money, and that in itself is fine, but it diden´t suit the way I think, I like open source and I know
Open Source shoulden´t automaticly mean free, Free as in Freedom not as in Free Beer I know.
This project like the others are build to meet my needs, I will continue to work on it if I find new ideas, and I am sure it will take on a life of it own and improve, such is the nature of Open Source.
I have had good use of this for the last few years, I hope you will find it useful as well.
